## Synchronous Code

- Synchronous code is **executed line by line**.
- Each line of code **waits** for previous line to finish.
- Long-running operations **block** code execution.

## Asynchronous Code

- Asynchronous code is executed **after a task that runs in the background finishes**.
- Asynchronous code is **non-blocking**.
- Execution doesn't wait for an asynchronous task to finish its work.

## What are AJAX Calls ?

**Asynchronous Javascript And XML** - Allows us to communicate with remote web servers in an **asynchronous way**. With AJAX calls, we can **request data** from web servers dynamically.

## What is an API ?

**Application Programming Interface** - Piece of software that can be used by another piece of software, in order to **allow applications to talk each other**.

There are many types of API's in web development

- DOM API
- Geolocation API
- Online API

**Online API** - Application running on a server, that receives requests for data, and sends data back as response. Some people commonly call it only **API** or **Web API**.

We can build our own **Web APIs** (requires back-end development, eg. with node.js) or use 3rd-party APIs.
